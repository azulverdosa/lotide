//pseudo code:
//create a function that takes an array(to filter through) and object(to use as parameters for filter)
//returns an object of everything the input object listed 
  //items should be elemts from the array that match keys from the object that hole the value of truthy 
    //omit anything with a value truthy who's key does match an element in the array
//function should report back how many instances of each item were found in allItems - object
  // return a proper report on all the strings found in the input array, and their respective counts.

//approach:
//array = allItems
//object = itemsToCount

//execution:
const assertEqual = (actual, expected) => {
  console.log(
    actual === expected
    ? "Assertion Passed: " + String.fromCodePoint(0x2705) + ` ${actual} === ${expected}`
